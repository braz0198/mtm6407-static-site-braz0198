# About me

### Hello, welcome to my static site. I am a 25 year old Interactive Media Designer currently studying at Algonquin College. My passion lies in film photography, but I have a new found love for graphic design. I aim to continue practicing these mediums to further my skills and learn new techniques. I also have a clothing store named Consume Vintage, specializing in giving nostalgic items and clothing a second home.
### Take a look at consumevintage.myshopify.com
### Everything is hand selected and curated by me to ensure that you are always are buying quality goods. Consume less, Consume Vintage.
